## Abstract


  We present a computer formalization of the problem  known as affine reduction
  of a projective plane. The affine reduction (aka affinization) consists in the
  definition of an affine plane by removing a line of a projective plane.
  We work with  a representation of  von Plato
  axiom system of constructive geometry which allows the definition of
  affine and projective geometry as variants of a common structure
  called *apartness* geometric.
  
  The formalization is written in Agda, a functional programming language
  and proof-assistant based on the proposition-as-types paradigm.
  All mathematical definitions, propositions and proofs are constructed following the valid
  methods
  of constructive mathematics, and they are directly expressed in
  the language Agda.

  In addition to the description of a new formalization of an interesting
  mathematical problem, the paper can be also considered as a tutorial to introduce
  ideas about  formalization of mathematics in type theory.
